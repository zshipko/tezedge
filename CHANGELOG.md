## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-29

### Added

- RPCs for every protocol now support the Tezos indexer 'blockwatch/tzindex'.
- Support for connecting to Mainnet.
- Support for sandboxing, which means an empty TezEdge can be initialized with `tezos-client` for "activate protocol" and do "transfer" operation.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-06-25

### Added

- Mempool P2P support + FFI prevalidator protocol validation.
- Support for sandboxing (used in drone tests).
- RPC for /inject/operation (draft).
- RPCs for developers for blocks and contracts.

### Added

- Support for connection to Carthagenet/Mainnet.
- Support for Ubuntu 20 and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.
- RPCs for indexer blockwatch/tzindex (with drone integration test, which compares indexed data with Ocaml node against TezEdge node).
- Flags `--store-context-actions=BOOL.` If this flag is set to false, the node will persist less data to disk, which increases runtime speed.

### Changed

- P2P speed-up bootstrap - support for p2p_version 1 feature Nack_with_list, extended Nack - with potential peers to connect.

### Removed

- Storing all P2P messages (moved to tezedge-debugger), the node will persist less data to disk.

### Fixed / Security
